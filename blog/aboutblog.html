<p>I’m bogged down with work at the moment and can’t dedicate the time
to writing anything of note, so I’ll just talk a bit about how I made
this blog.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to generate the pages and table of contents, which
you can see <a href="https://github.com/zoedelphi/blog">here</a>. The
pages are generated using Pandoc Markdown, which is one of the reasons I
decided to roll my own script - the tables especially are nicer to use
than any other Markdown dialect I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Other than <em>pandoc-ruby</em>, which provides pandoc bindings, the
only other library used was <em>date</em> from the Ruby standard
library. A large portion of the time spent working on this script was
figuring out how to sort by date for the table of contents - currently I
parse the exact line of the file that contains a date value and use this
to sort an array of files. The script is rather inefficient though, due
to my use of IO.readline() which was the most readable option but also
reads the entire file when I only need two lines from it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this was a fun experiment and hopefully will be a good
addition to my website.</p>
